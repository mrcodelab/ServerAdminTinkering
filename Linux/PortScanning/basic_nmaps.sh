# scanning for UDP ports
"""Nmap does this by sending a zero byte UDP packet to each port on the target
machine or device. If it receives an ICMP port unreachable message, it
determines the port is closed. Otherwise it assumes the port is open.

The problem with this technique is that itâ€™s not uncommon for network
equipment to block unreachable messages. This can lead to false positives.
Due to these factors, it can be difficult to determine real open UDP
ports vs. filtered false positive ones. Nmap UDP scan requires root privileges.
